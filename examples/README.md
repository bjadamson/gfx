## Where are the examples?
The examples are split across three crates: gfx_core, gfx_render, gfx_support.

* [gfx_core/examples](../gfx_core/examples) contains low level examples.
* [gfx_render/examples](../gfx_render/examples) contains examples that show how to use the gfx_render crate directly.
* [gfx_support/examples](../gfx_support/examples) contains examples that utilize the gfx_support module, showing you how you can build an
application with minimal setup.
